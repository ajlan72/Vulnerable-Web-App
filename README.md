# Amazin ‚Äì Vulnerable E-commerce Web App

**Amazin** is a deliberately insecure PHP-based storefront built for hands-on security testing and learning.

It mimics a real online store and includes common web vulnerabilities:

- SQL Injection (SQLi)
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- Broken Access Control
- CSRF
- Weak authentication

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This app is intentionally vulnerable. Do **not** expose it to the internet or use it in production.

     ```

3. Run the app locally:
